New Config Setting
	•	Adds a new option in redirect.settings.yml:

allow_from_alias: true

By default, redirects from aliases are not allowed (to prevent problems like redirecting an alias that already points to a real node).
	•	A checkbox is added to the Redirect settings UI to enable it:
“Allow redirects from aliases.”

Introduces RedirectPathProcessorManager which customizes how inbound paths are processed:
	•	Normally, Drupal replaces aliases with their system path (e.g., /about-us → /node/1) before checking for redirects.
	•	The new manager allows keeping the alias itself as a possible redirect source, depending on allow_from_alias.
	•	It collects both system paths and aliases as candidates and passes them to the repository.
