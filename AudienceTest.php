As a AM person it will be difficult for me to manage all the tasks which includes below task mentioned it will be difficult for me to handle alone going forward in AM we dont have any other drupal resources

1. Github Action tracking
2. Log messages
3. Github issues
4. npm updates
5. module and library updates
6. Snyk issues
7. Drupal 11 upgrade
8. Defect issues

Drupal 11 upgrade should be handled by a separate drupal resource as we need to work on this daily follow up on the issue queue look for the MR requets or patches if there is no support from drupal.org going forward we need to remove those modules and write the custom one to achieve what this module swere doing it will be difficult to manage aklong with above task.
