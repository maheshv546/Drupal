Subject: Support Required for Managing Drupal Tasks and Drupal 11 Upgrade

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

As an AM resource, it will be difficult for me to manage all the ongoing tasks alone. Currently, in the AM team, we don’t have any other Drupal resources to support these activities. The list of tasks includes:
	1.	GitHub action tracking
	2.	Log message monitoring
	3.	GitHub issue tracking
	4.	NPM updates
	5.	Module and library updates
	6.	Snyk issue resolution
	7.	Drupal 11 upgrade
	8.	Defect issue management

The Drupal 11 upgrade in particular should be handled by a dedicated Drupal resource. This task requires daily follow-up on issue queues, monitoring merge requests or patches, and identifying unsupported modules. If certain modules are not maintained on Drupal.org, we may need to remove them and develop custom solutions to maintain functionality.

Managing all these tasks along with the upgrade effort will be difficult without additional support. Hence, I recommend assigning a dedicated Drupal resource to handle the Drupal 11 upgrade activities.

Regards,
[Your Name]
